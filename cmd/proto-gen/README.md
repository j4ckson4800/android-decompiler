# proto-gen

This is an example program which uses android-decompiler/decompiler package to extract proto definitions from apk files.

Please note: this program doesn't extract enums, cuz I'm a lazy ass. Maybe I will add it after a while.

## Usage

```bash
Usage of proto-gen:
    -apk string
        APK file to parse
    -o string
        Output directory
```

## Example output
